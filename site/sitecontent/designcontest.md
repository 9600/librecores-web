# LibreCores Design Contest

The
[Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation (FOSSi)](http://fossi-foundation.org)
looks for submissions for the LibreCores Student Design contest. Our
goal is to encourage students to contribute to open hardware and
actively participate in the community. This is *your* chance to be one
of the pioneers of the Open Hardware movement!

Submissions will be presented as posters during
[ORCONF](http://orconf.org) 2016 on October 7-9 in Bologna,
Italy. The best contributions will receive the LibreCores
Student Design Award  during the conference. There
will be a limited number of travel grants available for eligible
students.

## What work can I submit?

<img src="/img/freepik/paper.png" align="right" hspace="25" vspace="10" />

* Any component (Librecore, "IP Core") or hardware design
  (System-on-Chip, application-specific, etc.)

* Your submission can be specific to FPGAs, or ASIC flows

* Contrbutions to the EDA ecosystem (synthesis, packaging software,
  libraries that could be used for HW design).

The work must be created after ORCONF 2015, that is after October 2015
and published under an established Open Source license. You may submit
work that you created for other purposes, such as an implementation
you did as part of your bachelor or master thesis or a student project.

## Evaluation Criteria

Our design expert jury will judge your work based on the following
three criteria listed in order of importance:

* *Openness* Your work must be published under an established Open
  Source license, see
  [this article about FOSSi licenses](http://fossi-foundation.org/licenses.html)
  for more details about selecting a license.

* *Reusability* How easily can your work be used and modified by
  someone else? Is it well documented? Do you plan to continue to work
  on your project and help others to get started?

* *Usefulness* Is your work filling a much-needed gap in the world of
  Open Source hardware design? Something that was not there before?

Librecores prepared a general [guide](/docs) on building a Librecore
that can help you in getting your project to the public. There is also
a [helpful mailing list](mailto:discussion@librecores.org) if you have
any questions.

## Who can participate?

All students or teams of students that have completed their work since
October 2015 (date of last ORCONF) are invited to send their
contributions. It is not necessary that you are a enrolled as a
student at one of the universities where the organizers are from.

This year we will not be offering a million dollars in prize money, so
if you are in this for the money, we cannot offer you much. Instead, you
will get to present your work among the leaders of Free and Open
Source Silicon and promote your work. You will get the recognition in
the community and will act as a model for future competitions. We
believe that Open Hardware is a community effort, and taking part in
such activities will be a rewarding experience in itself.

In addition, you might travel to ORCONF in beautiful Bologna, Italy
for free! We are working on securing sponsorships for a limited number of
students for their travel arrangements. A travel grant committee will
distribute available travel grants among high-quality submissions with
limited own funding. Students will display their projects on Saturday,
the selection committee will review submissions and the posters, and
decide the winning entries on Sunday.
